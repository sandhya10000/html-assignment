            <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
            <hr />

            <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
            <h4>header size</h4>

            <p>
              and <b>color</b> of letters seen on the screen. The
              <font size="5">font size</font> can be changed as well, and
              actually gives more choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This
              shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <b>Now</b> is the <i>time</i> for all good
                <b><i>people</i></b> to <u>come</u> to the aid of their country.
